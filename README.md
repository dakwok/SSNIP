# SSNIP
The Spatial Splicing-derived Neoantigen Identifier Pipeline (SSNIP) allows for the precise characterization and spatial heterogeneity of neoantigens derived from cancer-specific splicing events (neojunctions). The code available in this repository are the neopeptide identifier stages: 1. Neojunction calling, 2. Neopeptide prediction, 3. Neopeptide presentation prediction, 4. Spatial heterogeneity characterization
